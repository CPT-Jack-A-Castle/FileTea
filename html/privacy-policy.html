<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>For the purpose of providing the service, Filetea has access to some attributes of the files shared by users. Specifically, the <i>name</i>, the <i>size</i> and the <i>MIME-type</i>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>These attributes are stored in non-persistent (RAM) memory server-side, and only for as long as the file is shared.</li>
  <li>Neither any of these attributes nor the IP address of the user sharing the file, is stored persistently in the server, not even in logs.</li>
  <li>These attributes are completely removed from the internal structures when the file is un-shared, or the user closes its session and stops using the service.</li>
</ul>

<p>When a transfer of a file occurs between two users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The contents of a file are never cached or stored server-side.</li>
  <li>The server process never analyzes or processes the contents of a file as it is being transferred.</li>
  <li>No cache or log entry identifying the file or the users involved, is kept after a file transfer completes.</li>
  <li>The IP addresses of the users involved in a transfer, are never stored persistently server-side, not even in logs.</li>
</ul>
